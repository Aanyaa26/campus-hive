            The 'Creators of Metaverse' program allows students to learn about AR & VR and
             gain hands-on experience with industry-grade AR software in developing immersive
              solutions.
            It is a three phase workshop.

Phase 1: The first phase is a 2-day workshop consisting of 2-hour sessions on Metaverse 101 and 
creating your first AR effect.

Phase 2: The second phase is a 1-month micro-internship program with project-based 
knowledge checkpoints, live lectures, and mentor sessions.

Phase 3: The final phase is the formation of alumni of the micro-internship cohorts 
into the 'Creators of Metaverse' community in chapters across the country, providing events 
and industry showcase opportunities.
